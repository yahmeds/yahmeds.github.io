## Overview

This project is a web-based application that allows users to manage a database of students, create and assign groups, and enforce validation rules through a clean and functional UI. It's built on a Node.js and MongoDB stack, with a custom-built REST API and a vanilla JavaScript front end.

The system supports student creation, updates, group assignments, and validation checks to ensure data consistency. Actions are confirmed via dynamic notifications instead of static status messages, offering an intuitive and responsive user experience.

- Enforce formatting and validation rules (e.g., ID uniqueness, input completeness)
- Initialize six predefined groups
- Assign or reassign students between groups directly
